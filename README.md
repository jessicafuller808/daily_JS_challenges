# ðŸ’» Daily JavaScript Challenges

Welcome to my daily coding challenge repo. 

## :thinking: Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* to practice logical thinking ðŸ§ 
* in pursuit of mastery of JavaScript fundamentals
* to be 133T

## :notebook: Some Notes

At the moment all the challenges here are from [Codewars](https://codewars.com) katas.
